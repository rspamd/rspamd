# This directory is scanned for *.conf files to define configuration for the
# modules that are not shipped by Rspamd by default.
# So you can add your own configuration for the modules you have written.
# Please bear in mind, that each file *MUST* have the outer block with
# the actual module name, e.g.:

module_name {
  param = "value";
  complex_param = {
    key = "value";
    other_key = "other value";
    flag = false;
  };
  limit = 10;
  duration = 10d;
